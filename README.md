## Chronophage paper
The code to reproduce all the analyses is located in the `analyses` folder. If you run all the scripts in order, all necessary output files will be generated to create the figures from the paper (scripts located in the `figures` folder).

Both the raw fastq files and count matrices can be downloaded from GSEXXX, along with relevant metadata.
