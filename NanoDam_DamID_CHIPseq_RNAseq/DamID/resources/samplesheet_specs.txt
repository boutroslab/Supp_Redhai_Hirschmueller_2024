• SampleID: Identifier string for sample. Must be unique for each sample.
• Tissue: Identifier string for tissue type
• Factor: Identifier string for factor
• Condition: Identifier string for condition
• Treatment: Identifier string for treatment
• Replicate: Replicate number of sample
• bamReads: file path for bam file containing aligned reads for ChIP sample
• bamControl: file path for bam file containing aligned reads for control
sample
dba 5
• Spikein: file path for bam file containing aligned spike-in reads
• ControlID: Identifier string for control sample
• Peaks: path for file containing peaks for sample. Format determined by
PeakCaller field or caller parameter
• PeakCaller: Identifier string for peak caller used. If Peaks is not a bed
file, this will determine how the Peaks file is parsed. If missing, will use
default peak caller specified in caller parameter. Possible values:
– “raw”: text file file; peak score is in fourth column
– “bed”: .bed file; peak score is in fifth column
– “narrow”: default peak.format: narrowPeaks file
– “macs”: MACS .xls file
– “swembl”: SWEMBL .peaks file
– “bayes”: bayesPeak file
– “peakset”: peakset written out using pv.writepeakset
– “fp4”: FindPeaks v4
• PeakFormat: string indicating format for peak files; see PeakCaller and
dba.peakset
• ScoreCol: column in peak files that contains peak scores
• LowerBetter: logical indicating that lower scores signify better peaks
• Counts: file path for externally computed read counts; see dba.peakset
(counts parameter)
For sample sheets loaded from a file, the accepted formats are comma-separated
values (column headers, followed by one line per sample), or Excel-formatted
spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx extension). Leading and trailing white space will
be removed from all values, with a warning.
